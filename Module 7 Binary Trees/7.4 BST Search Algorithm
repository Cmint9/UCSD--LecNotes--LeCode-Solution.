Binary Search Tree (BST) 

Given a BST, the task is to search for a node in this BST. In order to search for a value in BST,
We should consider it as a sorted array. 

Algorithms to search for a key in a given Binary Search Tree: 
Here are some steps: we compare the value to be searched with the value of the root 
                      Also, we need to repeat the above step till no more traversal is possible. 
                      If at any iteration, key is found, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Here we will explain the insert algorithm: 

Insert sort( insertion sort) is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each 
element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. 

# So we have to understand how this algorithm works: 
1. First, assume the first element is sorted, it should starts by assuming the first elemenet of the list is already sorted. 
2. Secondly, iterate through the other unsorted part: Keep iterating through the remaining elements of the list. 
3. Thirdly, each element in the unsorted part is compared with the other elements in the sorted part until the correct position is found. 
4. Shift elements: If the element being inserted is smaller than any element in the sorted part, the elements in the sorted part.
5. Insert the element: The element is then inserted into its correct position in the sorted part. 
6. Repeat the process: this process is repeated until all elements have been inserted into the sorted part. 



# Time complexity: 
worst-case: O(n^2) when the list is in reverse order
Best-case: O(n) when the list is already sorted
Average-case: O(n^2)

PushBack(deque, x)	Inserts x at the back of the deque	PushBack(deque, 41). Deque: 59, 63, 19, 41

PopFront(deque)	Returns and removes item at front of deque	PopFront(deque) returns 59. Deque: 63, 19
PopBack(deque)	Returns and removes item at back of deque	PopBack(deque) returns 19. Deque: 59, 63

PeekFront(deque)	Returns but does not remove the item at the front of deque	PeekFront(deque) returns 59. Deque is still: 59, 63, 19
PeekBack(deque)	Returns but does not remove the item at the back of deque	PeekBack(deque) returns 19. Deque is still: 59, 63, 19

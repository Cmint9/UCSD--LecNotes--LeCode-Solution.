A stack is often implemented using a linked list, with the list's head node being the stack's top

# "pop" : assign a lcoal variable with the head node's data, removing the head node from the list and returning the local variable.
# StackPop returns the head node's data, not the head node itself.


Array-based stack storage
A stack can be implementated with an array, 
"allocationSize" : an integer for the array's allocated size
length: an integer for the stack's length

"unbonded stack" is a stack with no upper limit on length

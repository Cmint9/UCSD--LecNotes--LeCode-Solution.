Here are the notes for the Midterm and the problems from the UCSD Course: 

# Question 1: The following code finds the number of digits in an integer. Identify the correct algorithm to find the maximum number of digits in an integer array.

FindLen(value) {
   if (value == 0)
      return 1
   digits = 0
   while (value != 0) {
      digits = digits + 1
      value = value / 10
   }
   return digits
}

Correct Answer: 
FindMaxLen(listOfAges, listSize) {
   maxDigits = 0
   for (i = 0; i < listSize; i++) {
      digitCount = FindLen(listOfAges[i])
      if (digitCount > maxDigits)
         maxDigits = digitCount
   }
   return maxDigits
}

Reason to pick the wrong answer: "digitCount = FindLen(listOfAges[i])" it should be call function 'FindLen' not 'FindMaxLen'.


# Question 2: Given the list (11, 22, 25), which is the correct way to add 32 to the list in ascending order?

correct Answer:   InsertAfter(list, 25, 32) 
  InsertAfter(list, 32) 
  Prepend(list, 32, 25) 
  Prepend(list, 32) 

Reason to pick the wrong answer: it should have 25 before 32, hence is (list,25,32)


# Question 3: Identify the commands for the following list operations.
Check that there are no items in a list
Insert 10, 50, 30, 40, and 20 at the end of the list
Arrange the items in ascending order

Correct answer: 
  
IsEmpty(list)

Append(list, 10)

Append(list, 50)

Append(list, 30)

Append(list, 40)

Append(list, 20)

Sort(list)
Reason to pick the wrong answer: It should be use "Append", not "Prepend".


# Question 4: Which XXX would complete the following Python insertion sort algorithm?
def insertion_sort(num_list):
    for i in range(1, len(num_list)):
        j = i
        XXX:
            temp = num_list[j]
            num_list[j] = num_list[j - 1]
            num_list[j - 1] = temp
            j -= 1

Correct Answer:  while num_list[j] < num_list[j - 1] and j > 0
Reason to pick the wrong answer: from the code, we can know they need do compare, and we 
need to know how to compare them correctly.


#Question 5: For forward traversal of a singly-linked list, the ListTraverseRecursive(node) function must _____.
Wrong answer:   call ListTraverseRecursive(node⇢next), then visit the node 
Correct Answer: visit the node, then call ListTraverseRecursive(node⇢next) 
                 Call ListTraverseRecursive(node), then visit the node 
                 visit the node, then call ListTraverseRecursive(node) 

Reason to pick the wrong answer: is that it should be visited first to see how many nodes there are and which nodes. 
Then can call the function to traverse the nodes.

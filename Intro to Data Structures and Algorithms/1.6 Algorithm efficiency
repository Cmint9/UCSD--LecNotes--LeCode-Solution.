Algorithm efficiency is typically measured by the algorithm's computational complexity. Computational complexity is the amount of resources used by the algorithm. 
The most common resources considered are the runtime and memory usage.

an algorithm's runtime may vary significantly based on the input data, a common approach is to identify best and worst case scenarios. 
An algorithm's best case is the scenario where the algorithm does the minimum possible number of operations. An algorithm's worst case is the scenario where the algorithm does the maximum possible number of operations.

# FindFristLessThan algorithm best and worest case
FindFirstLessThan(list, listSize, value) {
   for (i = 0; i < listSize; i++) {
      if (list[i] < value)
         return list[i]
   }
   return value // no lesser value found
}

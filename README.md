In UCSD's Algorithms class, we can practice algorithms and data structures from different modules each week. zybook provides us with a fairly rich collection of practice problems that can help us reinforce our review after learning a concept.

### Module 1: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

### Module 2: Searching and Algorithm Analysis

### Module3: Sorting Algorithms

### Module4: Lists

### Module5: Stacks and Queues

### Module6: Hash Tables

### Module7: Trees

### Module8: Algorithms

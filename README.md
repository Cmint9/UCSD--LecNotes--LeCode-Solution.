# UCSD Data Structure and Algorithm

In UCSD's Algorithms class, we can practice algorithms and data structures from different modules each week. Zybook provides us with a fairly rich collection of practice problems that can help us reinforce our review after learning a concept.

Topics Covered:
- Sorting (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LIS, LCS)
- Complexity Analysis

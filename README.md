# UCSD Data Structure and Algorithm

In UCSD's Algorithms class, we can practice algorithms and data structures from different modules each week. Zybook provides us with a fairly rich collection of practice problems that can help us reinforce our review after learning a concept.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.)
- Recursion and Divide & Conquer
- Searching Techniques (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LCS, LIS)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)
- Complexity Analysis

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a core module in the course:
- `sorting algroithm(Module3)/` – Implementations and complexity comparisons
- `recursion/` – Classical recursion examples and use cases
- `Module5 Stacks and Queues/` – Step-by-step DP problems with recursion tree analysis
- `Module 6 Hash Tables/` – Graph traversals and shortest paths with real-world applications
- `resources.md` – My reading notes, references, and extra practice sets

## 📌 Why This Repo Matters

- 📚 Serves as my personal review notebook for future research and interviews
- 💡 Built from textbook and lecture knowledge, but written in my own words
- 🔍 Will be expanded with more advanced examples and complexity breakdowns

## 🚧 Future Plans

- Add time/space complexity visualizations using Matplotlib
- Integrate interactive demos using Streamlit
- Link LeetCode-style problems solved using the same concepts

O Notation: 

Big O notation is a powerful tool. We usually use to used describe the time complexity or space complexity of algorithms. 

# Importance of Big O notation 
1. Big O notation is important because it helps analyze the efficiency of algorithms
2. It provides a ways to describe how the runtime or space
3. It helps in understanding the scalability of algorithms and predicting how they will perform as the input size grows.

#Here are some examples:
1. Reflexivity 
2. Transitivity 
3. Constant Factor 
4. Sum rule
5. Product rule 
6. Composition rule

# Algorithm
An algorithm is a sequence of steps for accomplishing a task. Linear search is a search algorithm that starts from the beginning of a list, and checks each element until the search key is found or the end of the list is reached.

## Linear search algorithm 
Linear search starts at the first element and compares elements one by one.
Linear search compares all elements if the search key is not present.

# Linear search algorithm
LinearSearch(numbers, numbersSize, key) {
   i = 0

   for (i = 0; i < numbersSize; ++i) {
      if (numbers[i] == key) {
         return i
      }
   }
      
   return -1 // not found
}
   
main() {
   numbers = {2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 32, 45, 87}
   NUMBERS_SIZE = 8
   i = 0
   key = 0
   keyIndex = 0
      
   print("NUMBERS: ")
   for (i = 0; i < NUMBERS_SIZE; ++i) {
      print(numbers[i] + " ")
   }
   printLine()
      
   print("Enter a value: ")
   key = getIntFromUser()
      
   keyIndex = LinearSearch(numbers, NUMBERS_SIZE, key)
      
   if (keyIndex == -1) {
      printLine(key + " was not found.")
   } 
   else {
      printLine("Found " + key + " at index " + keyIndex + ".")
   }
}

(Here is the output to explain the code)
Output here:  
NUMBERS: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 87 
Enter a value: 10
Found 10 at index 3.
...
NUMBERS: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 87 
Enter a value: 17
17 was not found.

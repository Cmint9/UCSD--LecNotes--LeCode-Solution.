## Binary  Search 
 also finds the location of a key value in a list, but it is much faster than a linear search because the search is performed on a sorted list.
If we calcluate the idex: mid = (high+low_ //2
# Binary Search algorithm

def binary_search(numbers, key):
    # Variables to hold the low, middle and high indices
    # of the area being searched. Starts with entire range.
    low = 0
    mid = len(numbers) // 2
    high = len(numbers) - 1
   
    # Loop until "low" passes "high"
    while (high >= low):
        # calculate the middle index
        mid = (high + low) // 2

        # Cut the range to either the left or right half,
        # unless numbers[mid] is the key
        if (numbers[mid] < key):
            low = mid + 1
      
        elif (numbers[mid] > key):
            high = mid - 1
      
        else:
            return mid   
   
    return -1 # not found


# Main program to test the binary_search() function

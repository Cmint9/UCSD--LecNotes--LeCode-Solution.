For the growth of functions means that  to how the resources (like time or memory) required by an algorithm increase as the input size grows.
Hence, we can follow the four different fields to understand. 

Big O Notation: A way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity. It describes how the algorithm's resource usage grows as the input size increases. 
Input Size (n): The number of elements or the size of the data being processed by an algorithm. 
Time Complexity: How the execution time of an algorithm increases with the input size. 
Space Complexity: How the memory usage of an algorithm increases with the input size

ADTs define the behavior of data structures without specifying their implementation.

Common examples: lists, stacks, queues, set trees and graphs.
Here are a detailed breakdown of linear data structure and Non-linear Data structure: 

Linear Data Structure:

List: an ordered collection of elements that allows access, insertion, and removal of elements
by index. e.g. ArrayList, linkedList

Stack: A collection where elements are added and removed following a LIFO Principle

Queue: A collection where elements are added and removed FIFO

Non-Linear Data Structure: 

Set: stores unique elements, allowing for memvership testing, insertion and removal
Map: key-value pairs where each key is unique and associated with a single value
Tree: A hierarchical structure with a root node with subtrees
Graph: A collection of nodes and edges that connect them
